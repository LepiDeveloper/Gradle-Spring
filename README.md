### Domain Explanation and Entity Relations

This project focuses on managing the relationships between rockets, missions, and their launch sites. The relationships are as follows:

- **Rocket - Missions (Many-to-Many)**: A rocket can be used for multiple missions, and a mission can use multiple rockets.
- **Missions - Launch Sites (Many-to-One)**: A mission is launched from one launch site, but a launch site can host multiple missions.
